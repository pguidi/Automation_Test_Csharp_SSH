*STEPS:*
{noformat}

1 - Created SIP line for phone A (2012048934), phone B (2012048933) and phone C (2012048932)
2 - Enabled 3-way-calling on ONT for phone A
3 - On switch the flash-hook call service must be kept "Endpoint" (default)
4 - Initiated a call from phone A to phone B and it was established
5 - Flashed phone A
6 - Dialed from phone A to phone C
7 - Answered phone C
8 - Flashed phone A
	- Verified that phone A, phone B and phone C were in conversation correctly
9 - Took phone A hang up
	- Verified that phone B and phone C were in conversation
		*** The call was not terminated because the ONT is enabled call-transfer funcion for default. This function is not possible setting by OLT
